I’ll admit, some technical reading that pulled apart quarks in an atom. Others, well, I didn’t expect that plane to land on cartoon wheels. In all, this superseded expectations. Great classmates, great conversation, great thinking, and great fun. Looking forward to continuing with you all on this journey. And am looking forward to a wonderful conclusion to this course. I hope to work with you on my project! If you can’t see my video below - check it out here, at Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/245187075 Figure 1.1: Dont Hesitate - Vote HYD8! 1.0.1 HYD8 - Water to Go Figure 1.2: Can we change the way people think about water? I’m really excited about this idea. Despite public water sampling across the country, there is no easy way for individuals to tell the quality of their tap water. This uncertainty leads many to buy expensive bottled water that may or may not be better quality. What if we could help bring data together to inform users to make better decisions? What if that information helped consumers in places like Flint or Houston know water wasn’t safe? Or consumers in NYC to know their tap water is better than what’s in the bottle? Small changes could impact health and environment alike. I think it’s possible and probable that this idea gains traction outside of this course. I’d love to join with you to help see how we together expand this idea and see if it can take root into something real! 1.0.2 Campaign Chemistry My wife is a fashion agent – meaning she helps models, photographers, and clients (think Vogue or Target) create campaigns for their new products. This process of matching ideas, looks, and people to make something impactful in the market rests nearly entirely on gut instinct of a few people. This idea stems around pulling data such as trends in fashion data, success of product and photographer, and social network reach of the models to help give a possible influence score of the mix of inputs. This score would help designers or art directors make informed decisions on which teams to pair on projects. Who knows – this idea and your help could end up on a billboard in Times Square!?! 1.1 About the author - Dave Owen Dave is a strategy and finance consultant at a boutique consulting firm called Berkeley Research Group.

Those choices feed big business – both consequential for our utilities and the beverage industry. According to a global article in The Guardian last year, the bottled water industry is expected to reach $280 billion by 2020. We drink a lot of water. How safe is the water you drink? Recent water quality events – such as in Flint, Michigan or areas hit by recent hurricanes bring water quality and safety into focus for a number of consumers. Additionally, insights into the harm of BPA (bisphenol A – an estrogen-mimicking chemical) have led to questions of the safety of water bottles. Your decision is important - and should be founded on clear information rather than advertising. 2.2 {1.2} Real-time, for your location, for you! The confusion by the consumer isn’t needed. Gathering data from a vast network of water sampling stations across the US Geology Survey and the EPA, we’ve collected live sampling results to let you know the true safety of the tap water in your area. Because you have options, we help you compare your water options based on safety, taste, and environmental impact. Our online and phone app helps communicate relative performance of local tap against selected brands of bottled water to help inform the consumer. 2.2.1 Safety: Tap measurements are compared to bottle samples for content – with drill down into historical data and predicted values for contaminants - for example, iron, mercury, organics material, or presence of other dangerous contaminants. These contaminants are compared against public safety thresholds, both as individual elements and in aggregate. 2.2.2 Environmental Impact: Additionally, measures of environmental impact of both tap and bottled are presented using a life cycle assessment method to provide a standard definition of environmental impact. This measure will tell you how much better or worse your drinking choice is for the environment. 2.2.3 Taste: Using measures of contaminants that impact taste – e.g. chlorine, metallic, earthy flavors – are compared to help you understand the flavor profile of your water. 2.3 {1.3} Better water decisions The tool provides a streamlined, real-time, and unbiased comparison of tap vs. bottle water. The interface simply conveys contaminant information and helps compare relative quality of water received. Additionally, the app illustrates the carbon footprint comparison of the tap vs. bottle option. Given the ease of use of the app and the consumption of bottled water last year (480 billion bottles according the sourced Guardian article), the app is expected to influence decision making for millions of consumers. While the belief is that consumers will change their behavior in many cases – switching from tap to bottle and vice-versa – the tool will build confidence in the consumer decision making.

As you know, the point of critical decision making occurs during the casting. When you bring in the fashion models to meet the client, and often the designer or photographer you create a meaningful moment. At this instant all the pieces of an ad campaign come together - the clothing, the model, the ad concept, and the economics. With so many complex considerations, you trust your instinct to lead to the best advertising possible. You have exceptional control - based on your reputation for having an “eye for fashion”. Campaign Chemistry helps you protect your reputation. 3.2 {2.2} Crafting influence An eye for fashion is nearly impossible to define. However, success for a campaign may be possible to measure. Campaigns ultimately carry weight when they create influence – and influence can be approximated by revenue generation, clicks, and subsequent changes in style. Now that brands, photographers, and models have deep social networks, there may be a way to better quantify influence. 3.3 {2.3} Supporting better campaign decisions Campaign Chemistry helps you take good campaigns and make them great. Our product provides a clear portfolio optimization perspective on upcoming campaigns by listing your options by estimated cost and influence. To do so, our analysis provides a predictive influence score by blending the components of network (model, photographer, and brand social network connections and activity) and fashion (color, design, model, and brand relevance based on changing habits of customers). This score is then compared with a cost to deploy calculation (agency fees, advertising purchase costs). With these two predictive calculations, we plot the influence score vs. the cost to delivery to get an efficient frontier – most influence vs. cost for all options. This information will help decision makers make better portfolio decisions for upcoming campaigns. We provide information at the point of decision making that you’ve never had before. This insight helps you gain trust in your decisions – allowing you to pay the right price and maximize the reach of your creative genius. "]
