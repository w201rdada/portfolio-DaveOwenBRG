## Information to better help you decide

Do you have anxiety over the safety of the water you drink? Do pay for bottle water under the assumption that it is safer to drink than your tap water? Conversely, did you buy a new water bottle to limit the environmental impact of bottled water? 

Each day we have a handful of choices on how we stay hydrated. Those choices feed big business – both consequential for our utilities and the beverage industry. According to a global article in The Guardian last year, the bottled water industry is expected to reach $280 billion by 2020. Recent water quality events – such as in Flint, Michigan or disaster areas hit by recent fall hurricanes and consumers are increasingly questioning what’s in their bottle. Your decision is important - and should be founded on clear information rather than advertising.


## Real-time, for your location, for you!

The confusion by the consumer isn’t needed. Gathering data from a vast network of water sampling stations across the US Geology Survey and the EPA, we’ve collected live sampling results to illustrate historical safety, likely current safety, and predictive safety of tap water in your area. Safety is considered against water quality parameters – for example, iron, mercury, organics material, or presence of other dangerous contaminants. These contaminants are compared against public safety thresholds, both as individual elements and in aggregate. On online and phone app helps communicate relative performance of local tap against selected brands of bottled water to help inform the consumer.

As each individual is unique – a behavior profile is created in the app to help weigh the decision making. Risk relates differently to different people. For example, healthy and active consumers may have a different risk threshold than consumers that have allergies or pre-existing conditions. Consumers who drink three glasses on average per day may have a different risk profile than someone who drinks eight glasses per day. A short biographic survey in the app and website helps cater the risk and recommendation feedback from the tool.


## Better water decisions 

The tool provides a streamlined, real-time, and unbiased comparison of tap vs. bottle water. The interface simply conveys contaminant information and helps compare relative quality of water received. Additionally, the app illustrates the carbon footprint comparison of the tap vs. bottle option. Given the ease of use of the app and the consumption of bottled water last year (480 billion bottles according the sourced Guardian article), the app is expected to influence decision making for millions of consumers. While the belief is that consumers will change their behavior in many cases – switching from tap to bottle and vice-versa – the tool will build confidence in the consumer decision making.
