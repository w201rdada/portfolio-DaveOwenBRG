Helping Advertisers Make Better Fashion Decisions

## High fashion is largely driven by gut instinct {2.1}

As an advertiser, you have an exceptional influence on fashion trendsetting. As you know, the point of critical decision making occurs during the casting. When you bring in the fashion models to meet the client, and often the designer or photographer you create a meaningful moment. At this instant all the pieces of an ad campaign come together - the clothing, the model, the ad concept, and the economics. With so many complex considerations, you trust your instinct to lead to the best advertising possible. You have exceptional control - based on your reputation for having an “eye for fashion”. Campaign Chemistry helps you protect your reputation.

## Crafting influence {2.2}

An eye for fashion is nearly impossible to define. However, success for a campaign may be possible to measure. Campaigns ultimately carry weight when they create influence – and influence can be approximated by revenue generation, clicks, and subsequent changes in style. Now that brands, photographers, and models have deep social networks, there may be a way to better quantify influence.

## Supporting better campaign decisions {2.3}

Campaign Chemistry helps you take good campaigns and make them great. Our product provides a clear portfolio optimization perspective on upcoming campaigns by listing your options by estimated cost and influence. 

To do so, our analysis provides a predictive influence score by blending the components of network (model, photographer, and brand social network connections and activity) and fashion (color, design, model, and brand relevance based on changing habits of customers). This score is then compared with a cost to deploy calculation (agency fees, advertising purchase costs). With these two predictive calculations, we plot the influence score vs. the cost to delivery to get an efficient frontier – most influence vs. cost for all options. This information will help decision makers make better portfolio decisions for upcoming campaigns. 

We provide information at the point of decision making that you've never had before. This insight helps you gain trust in your decisions -- allowing you to pay the right price and maximize the reach of your creative genius.
