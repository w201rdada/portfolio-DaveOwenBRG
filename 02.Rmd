## High fashion has been the work of a few influences, largely driven by gut instinct for future trends.

Fashion is a leadership driven industry, where designers and brands rule the trendsetting. Retail, on the other hand, is a marketing and supply chain driven industry. How do the good advertisers negotiate the path between these two worlds? In A Devil Wear’s Prada, Meryl Streep’s Anna Wintour* like character implies the skill as an advertiser is to have an “eye for fashion”.

## How advertisers currently build campaigns.

As an advertiser – those selecting the models and matching the photographer to the set and to the clothing, this eye for fashion is nearly impossible to encapsulate. The feel for decision making resides so frequently in the gut. This decision making weighs the inputs into the campaign (models, photographers, brands) vs. the cost to achieve the vision vs. the benefit of the output.

Campaigns ultimately carry weight when they create influence – and influence can be approximated by revenue generation, clicks, and subsequent changes in style. Now that brands, photographers, and models have deep social networks, there may be a way to quantify influence.

## Helping build better campaigns.

What if a little help to the advertiser can tip the balance between a good vs. a great campaign? What if we can give the advertising exec a clear portfolio optimization perspective on upcoming campaigns? By listing options by cost and influence. The information will help advertisers make better tactical decisions – should I pay more for this fashion model or less for this one? – resulting in longer term success. 

Our analysis provides a predictive influence score by blending the components of network (model, photographer, and brand social network connections and activity) and fashion (color, design, model, and brand relevance based on changing habits of customers). This score is then compared with a cost to deploy calculation (agency fees, advertising purchase costs).

With these two predictive calculations, we plot the influence score vs. the cost to delivery to get an efficient frontier – most influence vs. cost for all options. This information will help decision makers make better portfolio decisions for upcoming campaigns.
